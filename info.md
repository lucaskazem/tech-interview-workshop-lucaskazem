PID: lucaskazem

Partner PID: shubansridhar

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to attend class because I was sick so I did not have a partner to complete this with in person.
I sent my solution to Shuban for him to review.

Feedback: The code works but the looping part is a bit more complicated than it needs to be. 
He also suggested avoiding changing the input array directly and focusing on a cleaner way to check neighboring spots while looping through.
